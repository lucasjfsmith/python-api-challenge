# python-api-challenge
This activity is broken down into two deliverables: WeatherPy and VacationPy

### WeatherPy
This project uses OpenWeatherAPI to analyze the day's weather from cities around the world. 

It explores the relationship between city's latitude and:
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Cloudiness
* Wind Speed

It also looks at these relationships when broken out into Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

### VacationPy
This project uses the Geoapify API and GeoViews to explore and map vacation options from the cities DataFrame used in WeatherPy.

It finds ideal vacation destinations based on temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness data.

It then finds nearby hotels for each ideal vacation destination and maps them using GeoViews.
